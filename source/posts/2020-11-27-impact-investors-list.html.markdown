The reason for this problem might be simply targeting the wrong types of investors.

That’s not a surprise, as there are dozens of VCs and business angels’ lists online, but hardly any, presenting an impact-focused investor scene.

That’s why we decided to gather them all in one [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KKJozFWOLnUAIbPoJUvxrUI0e2OzjttuzJf-SkQWH98/edit?usp=sharing).

Our primary goal is to provide a ready-to-use investors list for impact-driven startups looking for funding.

The second thing that we want to achieve is mapping the impact-investors ecosystem. That’s why everyone has the edit rights.

Do you know impact investors that should be featured on the list or are you an impact investor yourself?

Don’t hesitate to supplement the spreadsheet!
