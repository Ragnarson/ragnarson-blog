One of the common problems impact-driven founders face is finding the right investor.
It means someone who cares both about the profit and impact.

The reason behind this problem might be simply targeting the wrong type of investors.

That’s not a surprise since there are dozens of VCs and business angel lists online, but hardly any, presenting the impact-focused investor scene.

That’s why we decided to gather them all in one place, one spreadsheet.

[![spreadsheet](2020-12-09-opensourced-impact-investors-list/spreadsheet.png)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYEtoC8PoDbTZCpztXiw1oBNoUIdiMTfFUnnSz_yrWI/edit#gid=0)

Our goal is to provide a ready-to-use investors list for impact-driven startups looking for funding and map the impact-investor ecosystem. That’s why everyone has edit rights.

Do you know a VC or angel investor who should be listed there? Do you see any missing data points? Don’t hesitate to edit this spreadsheet and add even incomplete data.

We will do our best to gather the missing information.
