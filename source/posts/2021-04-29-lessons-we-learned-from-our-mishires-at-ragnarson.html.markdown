How to ensure that the teams you build are highly motivated and fit your company like a glove?
We've been asking ourselves this question for a few years now.

We came to the conclusion that it all starts with the recruitment process.

Each time we had a mis-hire at Ragnarson, we tried to improve our process to make sure that this never happens again.

One of the things we learned is that it's necessary to understand candidateâ€™s expectations in the first place.

Even if someone fits the technical requirements perfectly, they might be disappointed with work specifics - like working fully remotely, taking ownership, or working in a teal organization like ours.

In this video, Maciej GaÅ‚kiewicz shares two stories of recruitment failures that we've committed over the years.

Theyâ€™re both about mismanaged expectations and loss of time that could have been avoided if only we knew how to handle this situation back then.

Enjoy!
